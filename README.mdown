#FB Like Plugin
####by InformalThinkers (www.informalthinkers.com)



Did you ever wanted to add the famous Facebook like button to anything but contents? 
most joomla plugins that implement this feature are for contents only. and i needed 
them everywhere!

This is a system plugin, and is meant to appear on every page, i made an exception 
system to avoid showing the button on specific components and views. In the pluginâ€™s 
configuration you can add one component name per line (it should be the option GET 
value) and also in case you need to exclude just an specific view
